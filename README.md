# Synopsis

The Airbnb clone project is a replica of the original [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).
In this case, the console will be implemented.

The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

- Crete a new object.
- Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
- Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
- Update object's attributes.
- Destroy an object.
